\section{RationalGRL overview and metamodel}
\label{sect:preview}

\todo{Marc}{all}{I suggest the following subsections, so the methodology becomes part of this section. What do you think of this?}

\subsection{RationalGRL overview}

\todo{Marc}{all}{Explain general idea of RationalGRL, perhaps by explaining the difference between Figure 2 and 5.}

\subsection{Metamodel}

Extend the GRL metamodel with our concepts.

\subsection{RationalGRL methodology}

\todo{Marc}{Sepideh}{Finish this}

The methodology we propose in this paper is visualized in figure~\ref{fig:rationalgrl-methodology}. There are two main activities, depicted in grey, namely "goal modeling" and "argumentation". These are two separate activities that are being done in parallel.
