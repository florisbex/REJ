0:24:36.0 (P3)	& And, well interaction. Visualization sorry. Or interaction, I don't know. So create a visual map would have laying out roads and a pattern of their choosing. So this would be first, would be choose a pattern. & \multirow{3}{60mm}{\textbf{[31 critical question CQ?? for 14]} Is Task ``Create road'' clear?\\
\textbf{[32 answer to 31]} no, according to the specification the student should choose a pattern.\\

\hline
0:25:07.5 (P1)	& Yeah I'm not sure if they mean that. I don't know what they mean by pattern in this case. I thought you could just pick roads, varying sizes and like, broads of roads. & \textbf{[33 critical question CQ?? for 32a]} Is ``Choose a pattern'' clear?\newline
\textbf{[34 answer to 33]} No, not sure what they mean by a pattern.\\
\hline
0:25:26.0 (P3) & No yeah exactly, but you would have them provide, it's a pattern, it's a different type of road but essentially you would select- how would you call them, selecting a- & \multirow{3}{60mm}{\textbf{[34a REPLACE]} ``Choose a pattern'' becomes ``Choose a pattern preference''}\\

\textbf{[22 answer to 22]} Not useful, because according to the specification all intersections have traffic lights.\\
\hline
0:15:52.3 (P1) & (..) And on the technical side it's gonna be a real pain to remove one intersection you're gonna have to remove a lot more because there are only four-ways allowed and if you remove one intersection then-& \textbf{[23 critical question CQ2 for 20]} Is the task ``Remove intersection'' possible?\newline

0:23:41.2 (P2) & (..) If you can only control the set amount of influx from any side of this sort of random distribution, I think that is going to be less interesting than when you can say something like, this road is frequently traveled. (...) So setting it per road, I think is something we want & \textbf{[33 critical question CQ*2 on 36]} Is the task description specific/clear enough? \newline
\textbf{[34 answer to 37]} No, it is not clear where the influx is changing. Change to ``control car influx per road''\\

Like, what you say, cars come out at the end of the map side [are generated randomly] is performance wise and, I don't know, easier to make but it is less functional. Because you can't see traffic flows that easy because, well there's fixed amount of cars so there's not really gonna be jams [the simulation is less dynamic].
