\subsection{RationalGRL Language}
The RationalGRL language is an extension of GRL, which means that it includes all the GRL elements shown in Figure~\ref{fig:grl_legend}. However, there are also new elements (Figure~\ref{fig:rationalgrllegend}):

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Argument}: This represents an argument that does not correspond to a GRL element. created by answering one of the critical questions which disables a GRL element, or counter-attacks a previous argument. 
\item \emph{Rejected GRL element}: If an argument or GRL element is attacked by an argument, which itself is not attacked, then this GRL element will be rejected, meaning that it does not play a role in the analysis of the GRL model. The status of arguments and 
\item \emph{Refined GRL Element}: Not all critical questions attack a GRL element. It is also possible that a critical question \emph{replaces} an existing element (for instance, by clarifying the name of the element), or that it leads to the \emph{introduction} of a new element. In these cases, the corresponding GRL element is shown with a striped background. \todo{F}{S,M}{Disabled and Refined GRL elements are not in the metamodel}
\item \emph{Attack Link}: An attack link can occur between an argument and a GRL element, or between two elements. It means that the source argument or element attacks the target argument or element.
\end{itemize}

\label{fig:rationalgrllegend}
\end{figure}
\fi%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{itemize} 
\item \textsf{INTRO}: Introduce a new goal element or relationship with a corresponding argument. This operation does not attack the original argument to which the question pertains, but rather creates a new argument. %In Figure~\ref{fig:transcripts:grl}, each GRL element can be seen as the instantiation of an argument scheme. For instance, the XOR-decomposition from ``Generate Cars'' is an instantiation of AS5 as follows: ``Goal \texttt{Generate cars} XOR-decomposes into tasks \texttt{Keep same cars} and \texttt{Create new cars}''. Suppose now that the modelers that created Figure~\ref{fig:transcripts:grl} would continue their analysis by discussing critical question CQ5b: ``Does the goal \texttt{Generate cars} decompose into other tasks?'', and that they would answer this with ``Yes, namely \texttt{Choose randomly}''. This then results in the introduction of another task with the name ``Choose randomly'', and the XOR-decomposes would go from ``Generate Cars'' into the three tasks \texttt{Keep same cars}, \texttt{Create new cars}, and \texttt{Choose randomly}.'' %SG: Very good example. But should we also show it in the model as a new element?
\item \textsf{DISABLE:} Disable the element or relationship of an argument scheme to which critical questions pertains. This operation creates a new argument that disables (i.e., attacks) the original one. %In Figure~\ref{fig:transcripts:grl}, there are several examples of disabled GRL elements. The task ``Add traffic light'' (top-left in figure) is attacked by answering critical question CQ2: ``Is task Add traffic light possible?'' negatively, resulting in an argument that disables the GRL element. What we also see from Figure~\ref{fig:transcripts:grl} is that actor ``Teacher'' is disabled and thus all the elements that are bound to this actor are disabled as well. Furthermore, disabled task ``Dynamic Simulation'' also disables all incoming and outgoing links with this task.
\item \textsf{REPLACE:} Replace the element of the argument scheme with a new element. %In Figure~\ref{fig:transcripts:grl}, task ``Show map editor'' has been replaced various times, and this is shown in the figure as a \emph{refined} element. In this case, participants were discussing the correct naming for this element (CQ13), leading to various replacements of the name. While the previous names are not shown in the figure, they show up in the details pane of the corresponding element. %SG: why generate car has a star but not this one?
%\item \textsf{ATTACK:} Attack any argument with an argument that cannot be classified as a critical question. In Figure~\ref{fig:transcripts:grl}, we see one example of such a counter-attack. First, task ``Control car influx per road'' is attack by answering CQ2 (irrelevant task). However, after discussing this, participants found that this was not the case, since the problem description stated that it is important that students can control the simulation manually. Therefore, the argument that attacked the task is attacked by the counter-argument ``Important for students'', which re-enables the task ``Control car influx per road''. We provide a precise semantics for this in Section~\ref{sect:formalframework}.
\end{itemize}

%As an example of a RationalGRL model, consider Figure~\ref{fig:transcripts:grl}, which was created on the basis of transcript $t_1$. This figure shows a simplified version of the actual model in order to improve the presentation, but the full models can be found back in our repository.

The transcript excerpt of this example is shown in Table~\ref{table:transcript:irrelevant-actor} in the appendix and comes from transcript $t_3$. It consists of two parts: first participant \texttt{P1} puts forth the suggestion to include actor \texttt{Development team} in the model. This is, then, questioned by participant \texttt{P2}, who argues that the professor will develop the software, so there will not be any development team. However, in the second part, participant \texttt{P2} argue that the development team should be considered, since the professor does not develop the software.

We formalize this using a \emph{generic counterargument}, attacking the critical question. The first part of the discussion is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:examples:relevant-actor}. We formalize the first statement as an instantiation of argument scheme AS0: ``Actor \texttt{development team} is relevant''. This argument is, then, attacked by answering critical question CQ0: ``Is actor \texttt{development team} relevant? with \emph{No}. This results in two arguments, AS0 and CQ0, where CQ0 attacks AS0.'' This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:examples:relevant-actor}, left image.

Figure~\ref{fig:examples:relevant-actor2} shows the situation after the counter argument has been put forward. The argument ``Actor \texttt{Professor} does not develop the software'' now attacks the argument ``\texttt{Development team} is not relevant (\emph{The professor makes the software})'', which in turn attacks the original argument ``\texttt{Development team} is relevant''. As a result, the first argument is re-instantiated, which causes the actor in the GRL model to be enabled again.
